### Note on Code Quality

This project currently uses `Dictionary<string, object>` to process JSON data, 
which is not idiomatic C# and leads to unnecessary JsonElement conversions.

I acknowledge that a strongly-typed approach using proper C# model classes 
(e.g., Contract, Rule, NotificationEntry) would be cleaner, safer, and easier 
to maintain. Due to time constraints, I completed the initial implementation in 
a more Python-style dynamic structure, but I plan to refactor this codebase in 
a future update to follow better C# practices.

### To run the program
Build the ContractDemo.csproj and run Program.cs
Enter the date and contracts that fit the certain decision rules will be notified

If the date is entered and the contract is already notified, the notification won't be created

Three types of notifications exists and these can be found in config.json

Different type of contracts can be found in contracts.json
